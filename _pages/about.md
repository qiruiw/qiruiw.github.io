I am a Ph.D. student in [GrUVi Lab](https://gruvi.cs.sfu.ca/) & [3dlg-hcvc group](https://3dlg-hcvc.github.io/) at Simon Fraser University, supervised by Prof. [Angel X. Chang](https://angelxuanchang.github.io/). I also closely collaborate with Prof. [Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io/) and Prof. [Daniel Ritchie](https://dritchie.github.io/). My research interests lie in the intersection of computer vision, graphics and natural language processing. I'm particularly obsessed with:

- Open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding
- Scene-level 3D content creation
- Grounding natural language to 3D
